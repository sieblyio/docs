# Bitget: Node.js / TypeScript

Read public market prices with `bitget-api`. No API key is required for public prices.

Use Node.js 24 and npm.

## Run

From this folder:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The script prints a public REST price and exits.

To stream WebSocket prices until Ctrl+C:

```sh
npm run stream
```

This example uses public market data. Keep authenticated account and trading calls on your server. See the guide for this runtime’s requirements and limitations.
