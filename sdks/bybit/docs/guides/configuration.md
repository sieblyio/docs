# Configuration

## Configure a REST client

<<< @/../examples/configure-rest.ts

The first constructor argument contains SDK settings such as `testnet`, `key`, `secret` and `recv_window`. The second contains Axios request options, including `timeout` in milliseconds.

The example selects Testnet and a ten-second HTTP timeout. `recv_window` controls the signed request acceptance window; it is not the HTTP timeout.

## Select an environment

The default is live. Set `testnet: true` for Testnet or `demoTrading` for demo trading, with credentials for that environment. [Bybit's demo documentation](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/demo) lists supported endpoints.

## Rate-limit information

`parseAPIRateLimits: true` adds `rateLimitApi` from the response headers when available. Use it alongside [Bybit's endpoint limits](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/rate-limit) to schedule requests.

## Reuse clients

Reuse a client for each credential and environment combination. Limit concurrent requests in the application.
