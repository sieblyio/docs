# Subscribe to private account updates

Use `WebsocketClient` to receive private account updates, including orders, executions, positions and wallet changes. It supports Mainnet, Testnet and demo trading with credentials and topics supported by the selected environment.

This example uses Mainnet and the `order.linear` topic. It prints order changes for 60 seconds without placing or cancelling orders.

## Configure the connection

Mainnet is the default. For Testnet or demo trading, configure the stream and order clients for the same environment and use matching credentials; see [configuration](/guides/configuration#select-an-environment) for the options and supported features.

To run this example, use Node.js 24 with the [`bybit-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bybit-api) npm package installed. Create a private `.env` file with Bybit Mainnet credentials and permission to read your orders:

```dotenv
# Use your own Bybit Mainnet credentials.
BYBIT_API_KEY=example_key
BYBIT_API_SECRET=example_secret
```

Keep `.env` server-side and excluded from version control. Leave `BYBITTRACE` unset to avoid logging signed requests. The SDK signs the WebSocket authentication request.

Save the following as `private-stream.ts`:

<<< @/../examples/private-stream.ts

Run it:

```sh
node --env-file=.env private-stream.ts
```

## Observe an order

Wait for `Private stream authenticated.` and `Subscribed to order.linear.` before starting the [order example](/guides/orders) in another terminal using the same account. Authentication alone does not confirm a subscription.

Each update prints the exchange order ID, symbol, status, cumulative executed quantity and remaining quantity. Match `orderId` to the ID returned by the order example. Stream and subscription errors are logged with their error objects.

Bybit's `order.linear` stream emits changes, not an initial snapshot of all orders. Use REST once at startup to load existing state, accounting for events that arrive during that read. Then apply stream updates locally instead of querying REST after each submission or cancellation. A quiet stream can simply mean no orders have changed. See [Account State](https://siebly.io/reference/glossary#accountstate) for the startup, event-driven update and recovery pattern.

This example subscribes only to orders. Subscribe to the execution, position and wallet topics your application needs as well; an order update alone does not provide all account state. See [account state](/guides/production#keep-account-state-up-to-date).

For supported derivatives categories, position updates can trigger SL/TP placement or adjustment when a position opens or increases. Compare the previous and current position size, keyed by account, category, symbol and `positionIdx`; a position message alone does not establish a new fill. Use a [throttled debounce with a maximum wait](/guides/production#trigger-follow-up-work-from-position-changes) to combine partial-fill bursts without postponing the follow-up indefinitely.

The subscription uses the category-specific `order.linear` topic. To consume all supported categories, use `order` instead; do not combine it with category-specific order topics in the same subscription request. See Bybit's [private order stream](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/websocket/private/order).

## Handle disconnects and shutdown

The example runs for 60 seconds, including connection and authentication time. Its timer and Ctrl+C handler close the socket and clear the timer; network errors do not trigger shutdown.

The SDK reconnects, authenticates and restores subscriptions automatically. The example logs `reconnect`, `reconnected`, `close` and error events without interrupting that recovery. A `reconnected` event confirms the connection is open; the subsequent subscription response confirms `order.linear` is subscribed again.

Reconnection does not replay missed order events. Reconcile orders with REST after a gap, then continue processing updates. Closing the stream does not cancel open orders.

Bybit can emit two `Filled` order updates when a fill races with a cancellation. Track cumulative execution by order ID, or use execution records for individual fills.
