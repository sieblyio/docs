# Exchange

`CBExchangeClient` targets Coinbase Exchange at `api.exchange.coinbase.com`. Use Exchange credentials, accounts and product IDs throughout this guide.

## Setup {#setup}

Install `coinbase-api` with `npm install coinbase-api` and use Node.js 24 to run the examples. Public REST examples need no credentials. For authenticated examples, add the variables below to a private `.env` file excluded from Git and run `node --env-file=.env filename.ts`, replacing `filename.ts` with its filename. Keep account output private.

## Public REST {#market-data}

Save as `exchange-market-data.ts` and run `node exchange-market-data.ts`:

<<< @/../examples/exchange-market-data.ts

Use `getAllTradingPairs()` to discover products, `getProduct()` for size/price increments and trading restrictions, and `getProductBook()` for a book snapshot. Keep price and size strings at the exchange's supported precision.

## Public WebSocket prices {#public-streams}

Save as `exchange-stream.ts` and run `node exchange-stream.ts`:

<<< @/../examples/exchange-stream.ts

The stream runs until Ctrl+C. `ticker` updates arrive on `update`; inspect `response` for subscription confirmation and `exception` for errors. To maintain a book, use the Exchange `level2` channel and apply its snapshot/update rules. The singular `heartbeat` channel is available for connection activity.

## Authentication and account reads {#authentication}

Create an Exchange API key with the permissions needed by your application. Set:

```dotenv
COINBASE_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=your-exchange-key
COINBASE_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET=your-exchange-secret
COINBASE_EXCHANGE_API_PASSPHRASE=your-api-passphrase
```

The passphrase belongs to the API key, not your account password. Save as `exchange-account.ts`:

<<< @/../examples/exchange-account.ts

### Balances and current orders {#account-state}

`getAccounts()` supplies balances and holds. `getOrders()` defaults to open or unsettled orders; a settled order disappearing from this list does not mean it never existed. Use `getOrder({ order_id })` or `getFills()` for the specific history you need. Follow the endpoint's pagination rather than assuming one response is complete.

## Order management {#orders}

1. Read product rules and available balances, then build the Exchange request: `product_id`, `side`, `type`, and the applicable `price`, `size` or `funds` fields. These are flat fields, not an order-configuration object.
2. Generate and persist a client identifier with `client.generateNewOrderId()`, pass it as `client_oid`, and call `submitOrder()` only when ready to trade. This is a live operation.
3. Save the returned exchange order ID and follow private events. Use `getOrder({ order_id })` for a specific unresolved outcome, not as a routine follow-up to every submission.
4. Call `cancelOrder({ order_id })` to cancel an individual order. Cancellation can race with fills; reconcile the final state before submitting a replacement.

A timeout does not prove a submission failed. Match the original client/exchange identifiers against events and targeted reads before retrying.

## Private order updates {#private-streams}

Save as `exchange-private-stream.ts` and run with the Exchange environment variables:

<<< @/../examples/exchange-private-stream.ts

This subscribes to the authenticated Exchange `user` channel through `exchangeDirectMarketData`. The SDK signs the subscription using the Exchange key, secret and passphrase. `exchangeMarketData` is the public route; supplying credentials alone does not turn that route into this authenticated subscription.

Load initial orders and account state, then update them from user order events. For balance updates, the authenticated `balance` channel takes `payload.account_ids` containing Exchange account IDs. Do not assume the `user` channel itself is a full balance ledger.

The SDK restores subscriptions automatically after reconnecting. Mark state stale on `reconnect`, process incoming order events when the stream resumes, and reconcile missing orders, fills or balances through targeted REST reads. Account for events received during recovery. Resume trading only when the account state it depends on is current. See [Account State](https://siebly.io/reference/glossary#accountstate).

## Environments and reference {#environments}

`useSandbox: true` selects Exchange sandbox REST and WebSocket hosts. Use sandbox credentials for private requests. Keep separate client instances for live and sandbox accounts.

This SDK's `WebsocketAPIClient` does not provide Exchange order entry. Use REST for order commands and subscriptions for updates.
