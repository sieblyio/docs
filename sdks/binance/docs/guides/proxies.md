# Use a proxy

<!--@include: @/.vitepress/shared/proxies/scope.md-->

If your API key uses an IP allowlist, add the proxy's egress IP.

## HTTP or HTTPS proxy for REST

Axios accepts a `proxy` object in the REST client's second constructor argument:

<<< @/../examples/proxy-rest.ts

<!--@include: @/.vitepress/shared/proxies/rest-options.md-->

## Proxy agents for REST and WebSockets

<!--@include: @/.vitepress/shared/proxies/agent-setup.md-->

<<< @/../examples/proxy-agent.ts

`wsOptions.agent` configures the WebSocket connection. REST settings alone do not route WebSocket traffic through a proxy. The WebSocket client's `requestOptions` also configures internal REST calls, including listen-key creation and renewal for streams that use them. The same REST constructor pattern applies to `USDMClient`, `CoinMClient` and `PortfolioClient`.

`proxy: false` disables Axios's own proxy routing, including proxy environment variables, so the custom agent controls the REST route. Set `keepAlive: false` on the REST client and `restOptions.keepAlive: false` on the WebSocket client when using a custom agent. Enabling keep-alive replaces that agent with a standard HTTPS agent.

The `wsOptions` setting also applies to the WebSocket transport used by `WebsocketAPIClient`.

## SOCKS5

<!--@include: @/.vitepress/shared/proxies/socks.md-->

Use the same SOCKS agent in `wsOptions.agent`. Keep the internal REST `requestOptions` as well.

## Verify the route

Start with a public REST request such as `client.getSymbolPriceTicker({ symbol: 'BTCUSDT' })` and a [public subscription](/guides/websockets) using the configured clients. No API credentials are needed for these checks. Confirm both connections in your proxy logs; a successful REST request alone does not prove WebSocket routing.
