# Configuration

## Configure a REST client

<<< @/../examples/configure-rest.ts

The first constructor argument contains SDK settings such as `testnet`, `api_key`, `api_secret` and `recvWindow`. The second contains Axios request options, including `timeout` in milliseconds.

The example selects Spot Testnet and a ten-second HTTP timeout. `recvWindow` is the signed request acceptance window; it is separate from the HTTP timeout.

## Select a market and environment

`MainClient` uses Spot endpoints. `USDMClient` and `CoinMClient` target their respective futures products. Select the client first, then choose an environment supported by that product. `testnet: true` selects the supported test endpoint for the client; demo trading uses the separate `demoTrading` setting.

Keys and symbols depend on the product. See the [Binance documentation](https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs).

## Preserve decimal precision

Leave `beautifyResponses` disabled to preserve decimal strings. Use decimal arithmetic for exact calculations and apply the instrument's filters when formatting order quantities.

## Reuse clients

Reuse a client for each credential and environment combination. Limit concurrent requests in the application.
