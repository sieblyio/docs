# Subscribe to private account updates

Use `WebsocketAPIClient` to receive Spot account and order events through Binance's WebSocket API. It supports Mainnet and Spot Testnet; this walkthrough uses Testnet. Private account events are separate from public market-data subscriptions. Spot's older listen-key workflow is deprecated; use `subscribeUserDataStream()` for new integrations.

Use these events to keep local order and balance state up to date after REST submissions. There is no need to query each order after placing or cancelling it when the required updates have arrived. See [account state](/guides/production#keep-account-state-up-to-date) for startup and recovery.

For production Spot, set `testnet: false` (or omit it) and use production credentials.

## Example: connect to Spot Testnet

Use Node.js 24 and install the SDK with `npm install binance`. Set the Spot Testnet credential variables from [order management](/guides/orders#set-up). Keep signing credentials on the server and out of browser bundles.

Save this as `private-stream.ts`:

<<< @/../examples/private-stream.ts

Run it before placing an order in another terminal:

```sh
node --env-file=.env private-stream.ts
```

The SDK maps `WS_KEY_MAP.mainWSAPI` to the Spot Testnet WebSocket API when `testnet: true`. The helper uses `userDataStream.subscribe` on an authenticated Ed25519 session, or a signed `userDataStream.subscribe.signature` request for HMAC/RSA credentials. This example accepts an HMAC API secret through the environment; see [authentication](/guides/authentication) for credential handling.

Listeners are registered before subscribing so early messages are not missed. Once subscribed, the script waits for account activity. A quiet account may produce no events during the 60-second window.

## Read order events

The SDK unwraps the WebSocket API envelope before emitting `message`: inspect `message.e`, not `message.event.e`. With `beautify: false`, an `executionReport` includes:

- `s`: symbol.
- `i`: exchange order ID, which stays stable through cancellation.
- `x`: execution type, such as `NEW`, `TRADE` or `CANCELED`.
- `X`: current order status, such as `NEW`, `PARTIALLY_FILLED` or `FILLED`.
- `l`: quantity executed in the latest fill.
- `z`: cumulative executed quantity.

Match `i` to the `BINANCE_ORDER_ID` returned by the order example. The stream prints selected order fields, balance events and other received messages. Stream and subscription errors are logged with their error objects. Consult the [user data stream payloads](https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/user-data-stream) for the complete event definitions.

## Optional: readable fields with the SDK beautifier

The SDK beautifier turns Binance's short field names into descriptive properties and converts known numeric strings to JavaScript numbers. For example, `e`, `s`, `X` and `z` become `eventType`, `symbol`, `orderStatus` and `accumulatedQuantity`.

In `private-stream.ts`, set `beautify: true` in the existing `WebsocketAPIClient` options. Add `isWsFormattedSpotUserDataExecutionReport` to the existing `binance` import, then replace the raw `message` listener with:

```ts
ws.on('formattedMessage', (message) => {
  if (stopped) {
    return;
  }
  if (isWsFormattedSpotUserDataExecutionReport(message)) {
    console.log('Order update:', {
      symbol: message.symbol,
      orderId: message.orderId,
      status: message.orderStatus,
      filledQuantity: message.accumulatedQuantity,
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Account update:', message);
  }
});
```

Keep the existing subscription, error, reconnect and shutdown handling. Raw events still arrive on `message`; use those decimal strings when you need exact arithmetic rather than JavaScript floating-point numbers.

## Disconnect and recover

The SDK reconnects automatically after a dropped connection and restores the user data subscription. The example logs `reconnecting` and `reconnected` without closing the client or setting a failure exit code. It keeps the SDK's default `resubscribeUserDataStreamAfterReconnect` behavior enabled; no manual resubscription loop is needed.

`reconnected` confirms the socket is open again. Authentication and resubscription may still be completing. For applications that depend on complete account state, reconcile orders, fills and balances through REST after a gap; a restored subscription does not replay missed updates. Subscription rejections and other errors are logged for diagnosis.

The 60-second timer and Ctrl+C/SIGTERM end this demonstration explicitly. Closing the stream does not cancel orders.

To stop just a user data subscription while keeping a connection, await `unsubscribeUserDataStream(WS_KEY_MAP.mainWSAPI)`. To end all connections owned by this API client, call `disconnectAll()`. This example uses a dedicated client, so it closes all its connections. Remove application timers and signal listeners during shutdown.
