# Configuration

For HTTP, HTTPS or SOCKS routing in Node.js, see [Use a proxy](/guides/proxies).

## Configure a REST client

<<< @/../examples/configure-rest.ts

The first argument contains SDK options such as `apiKey` and `apiSecret`. The second contains Axios request options. Here, `timeout: 10000` sets a ten-second HTTP timeout.

Reuse a client for each account and product rather than creating one for every request.

## Environments

The clients use Kraken's live APIs by default. Spot has no public testnet. Kraken retired the public Futures demo environment; in this SDK, `testnet: true` throws instead of selecting a test environment. Kraken offers a separate testing environment to qualified clients through its API team; this SDK does not configure that access.

Use public market-data reads or [Spot order validation](/guides/orders) when developing without placing an order. Validation is not simulated trading and does not test fills or a complete order lifecycle.

## Credentials and products

Use Spot credentials with `SpotClient` and private Spot streams; use Futures credentials with `DerivativesClient` and private Futures streams. The [authentication guide](/guides/authentication) shows secure configuration for Spot.

For [streaming](/guides/websockets#subscribe-to-a-ticker), pass a connection key from `WS_KEY_MAP` to `subscribe()`. For example, `spotPublicV2` selects public Spot v2 data and `spotPrivateV2` selects [private Spot v2 data](/guides/private-streams#observe-spot-executions).
