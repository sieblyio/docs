# Production usage

## Resolve uncertain order outcomes

Kraken may accept an order even if the REST request times out. Check the private `executions` stream for the matching order or fill. If those events resolve the outcome, there is no need for a follow-up REST query.

If the response and stream leave the outcome unclear, use `SpotClient.getOrders()` with the exchange order ID. Without an ID, inspect open orders, closed orders and trades for the original pair, request time, side, price and volume. An empty or delayed result alone does not establish that the submission failed. Do not automatically repeat a state-changing request after a transport failure.

Save returned order IDs with the account and pair so you can match later events and recovery queries.

## Recover streaming state

`WebsocketClient` reconnects and restores subscriptions automatically. `reconnecting` signals that connection recovery is starting; mark the affected account state as stale. `reconnected` means the socket has reopened and is a useful trigger for REST reconciliation of missed orders, executions and balances, plus positions when using Futures. Listen for `exception` to diagnose errors and let the SDK handle reconnection.

The SDK handles authentication and resubscription; these may still be completing when `reconnected` fires. No manual resubscription is needed. Process the resumed streams’ snapshots and updates, and account for events received during REST recovery. Compare current account state and open orders with the intended state before making follow-up changes; do not blindly recreate orders. Resume dependent actions once the state they need is current.

Market-data channels have their own snapshot, update and checksum rules. Track feed health; an open socket alone does not establish that the data is current.

## Nonces and rate limits

Coordinate private requests that share an API key; independent processes can cause out-of-order nonces. Apply Kraken's REST and trading rate limits across the application, not separately in each worker.
