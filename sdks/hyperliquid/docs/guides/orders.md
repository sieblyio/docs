# Order management {#place-and-cancel-a-testnet-order}

Place a BTC perpetual limit order with `RestClient` and cancel any remaining quantity. Run the account stream alongside these REST commands to follow order updates and fills.

The example uses separate commands to place, cancel and check an order. In a persistent application, keep the account stream connected and track orders and fills locally. Use REST reads for startup, recovery and unresolved requests rather than after every order.

This walkthrough uses Hyperliquid Testnet and test funds to avoid accidental live trades. The same methods work on Mainnet, Hyperliquid's production markets. Remove `testnet` or set it to `false`, and use the Mainnet account address with an authorized signer to execute against live markets.

A post-only order is rejected if it would immediately take liquidity. Once resting, it can fill before cancellation. Cancelling an order does not reverse fills or close an existing position.

Before placing orders, use the [authenticated account read](/guides/authentication) to check balances and account access.

## Set up

To run this example on Testnet, use Node.js 24, a funded Hyperliquid Testnet account and an API wallet authorized for that account. See [API wallets and account addresses](/guides/authentication#api-wallets-and-vaults).

Install the [`@siebly/hyperliquid-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@siebly/hyperliquid-api) npm package:

```sh
npm install @siebly/hyperliquid-api
```

Create a private `.env` file and add it to `.gitignore`:

```dotenv
HYPERLIQUID_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111 # Example managed account
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222 # Public example key; use your API wallet key
HYPERLIQUID_ORDER_SIZE=0.001 # BTC; illustrative size
HYPERLIQUID_LIMIT_PRICE=60000 # USD; adjust for the current market
```

The address and key above are illustrative. Use the authorized API wallet's key and the account it manages. Signing runs locally in Node.js.

Set a size in BTC and a buy price below the current Testnet BTC best bid. The example passes both values as decimal strings; the exchange applies its current [tick and lot size rules](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/tick-and-lot-size).

## Save the example

Save the following as `orders.mts`. Node.js 24 runs this TypeScript file directly.

<<< @/../examples/first-order.ts

## Place the order

Start the [account order stream](/guides/private-streams) in another terminal for the same Testnet account. Wait for the server subscription acknowledgements for `orderUpdates` and `userFills`. Keep it running while you try the commands; the demonstration stops after 60 seconds.

```sh
node --env-file=.env orders.mts place
```

The script submits one order and prints its exchange-assigned numeric ID. Save the printed `HYPERLIQUID_ORDER_ID` line in `.env` for the following commands, for example:

```dotenv
HYPERLIQUID_ORDER_ID=123456789 # Use the ID returned by your order
```

`postOnly: true` selects the exchange's ALO order type. A successful response contains an individual result: `resting`, `filled` or `error`. The script checks that result rather than treating a fulfilled request as proof of acceptance.

Follow matching `orderUpdates` and `userFills` events as the order changes. The submission response can contain useful immediate results, while the stream continues to report later changes.

## Cancel remaining quantity {#query-and-cancel}

If the order still has open quantity, request cancellation:

```sh
node --env-file=.env orders.mts cancel
```

Watch the stream for the resulting order update or fill. Cancellation can race with execution, so the final status may be `filled`. The command does not query REST before or after cancelling.

## Recover an interrupted request

A timeout can occur after the exchange accepts a request. Check matching `orderUpdates` and `userFills` events first. If the outcome is still unclear, use the one-shot status command:

```sh
node --env-file=.env orders.mts status
```

This calls [`getOrderStatus()`](/api/classes/RestClient#getorderstatus) with the saved ID and account address, without a signing key. Use it for diagnosis or recovery, not after every submission. If no ID is available, inspect the account's open orders, order history and fills to resolve the outcome before resubmitting. The example does not retry writes.

`unknownOid` means no order was found for that account and ID. Check order and fill history to resolve an uncertain submission. Closing the script or a WebSocket does not cancel an open order.
