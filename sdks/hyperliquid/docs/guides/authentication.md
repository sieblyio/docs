# Account access and balances {#authentication}

Public market data and account queries do not require a signature. Exchange actions, such as placing or cancelling an order, require a private key or signer.

## Read account state

Set `accountAddress` to query an account without configuring a signer. This example reads its perpetual positions.

<<< @/../examples/account-state.ts

Set `HYPERLIQUID_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` before running the example. It uses Mainnet by default; add `testnet: true` to the constructor options to query Testnet. Perpetual positions are in `assetPositions`. For unified accounts or portfolio margin, [`getSpotBalances()`](/api/classes/RestClient#getspotbalances) returns balances across Spot and perps.

Account methods resolve addresses in this order: request `user`, `vaultAddress`, `accountAddress`, then the configured signer.

## Configure a private key

Pass `privateKey` and the managed account address to `RestClient`. This example uses Mainnet. Use the managed account address and a signer authorized for that account. For Testnet, set `testnet: true` and use the corresponding account and signer.

<<< @/../examples/authenticated-client.ts

Keep the private key in a secure server-side environment, supplied through a protected environment variable or a secret manager, outside source files and browser bundles.

## API wallets and vaults

An API wallet signs for another account. Set `accountAddress` to the managed account so queries return its balances and positions.

`vaultAddress` selects a vault or subaccount for supported actions and takes precedence over `accountAddress` for account queries. The signer must be authorized for the requested action. See the [Hyperliquid tutorial](https://siebly.io/sdk/hyperliquid/javascript/tutorial) for the account and API wallet setup workflow.

## Trading side effects

In SDK 1.0.3, the first trading action from a client instance also schedules a `SIEBLY` referral-code request. Orders check Siebly builder-fee approval and include the builder code only after approval is confirmed. With a main-wallet private key, the SDK can attempt builder approval in the background; API wallets cannot grant that approval. Review the [SDK referral and builder-code behavior](https://github.com/sieblyio/hyperliquid-api#referral--builder-codes-4-fee-discount) before configuring a signer for trading.

## Custom signers

Pass `signer` instead of `privateKey` to supply a [`HyperliquidSigner`](/api/interfaces/HyperliquidSigner). The interface requires `signTypedData()` and supports an `address` or `getAddress()` for address resolution. An ethers Wallet can satisfy this interface.

`WebsocketAPIClient` accepts the same signing options. `WebsocketClient` subscriptions use account addresses and do not need a private key.
