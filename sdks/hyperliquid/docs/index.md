# Hyperliquid API SDK

`@siebly/hyperliquid-api` provides JavaScript and TypeScript clients for Hyperliquid market data, account queries, signed trading actions and WebSocket subscriptions.

Build trading bots and automate your strategies in Node.js, or use real-time market data in a dashboard. Start with a public price request, then add authentication and order handling for your trading workflow.
